                        <p>I was born in the Philippines to two Filipino parents who loved and cared for me. At the age of three, my father received a job opportunity on the island of Guam. This allowed our family to immigrate there and brought on a wealth of experiences for all of us. Growing up in Guam allowed me to experience the melting pot of America. I learned how to speak English and the island culture at school. At home, my parents taught me our culture and how to speak Tagalog. I am grateful for their thoughtfulness to make sure I didn't forget where I came from. The lessons and principles I learned from my parents' experiences I have always kept with me. One of which is that of humility. Life wasn't always easy for my parents and it still isn't today but having a sense of humility, accepting the fact that they didn't know everything helped them greatly. By doing this, they had the desire to increase their knowledge and to always seek improvement in all things. I too share this same desire. At the age of eight, I experienced my first loss of life. My oldest brother, whom I looked up to, passed away during a scouting activity. I then learned how precious our time here on Earth was and even more so of life itself. Thus, gratitude became a common theme in how I viewed things in life. It allowed me to overcome trials and challenges that came my way, like the loss of my brother. Moving on in life, I made it a point to make the most of every second I've been gifted. I excelled in my academics as well as my extracurricular activities. I aimed to be the best I could be in all the things I took part in. I know that I'm where I'm at in life because of the positive influence around me. I hope to replicate this within the BYU community. By becoming a part of this institution, I hope to become another role model students can look up to, to inspire those around me to seek the best version of themselves. I hope to learn the best lessons in life and be able to share them with everyone I meet.</p>
                        <p>As we go through life, we learn many lessons. From learning to not touch a hot stove to learning how to care for loved ones, each stage of our lives is full of opportunities to grow as an individual. Being a missionary for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints has taught me many lessons but one that has stuck the most is that of studying the scriptures. Every morning, I spend an hour, at the least, searching and pondering the scriptures. Developing this habit has been impactful to the way I live my life. Often, I lose track of time when I am deep in my studies, and usually, I would have to continue my studies later on in the day just so I can finish my train of thought. Before the mission, I rarely studied the scriptures, be it the Bible or The Book of Mormon. I did not recognize the benefits of developing that habit of continuous reading and searching. I simply went through the motions and truly got out of it what I put into it. Now that I am serving a mission and that scripture study is part of my daily life, I can see what I have been missing out on, both temporally and spiritually. As I started my mission I carried the habits I already had onto the field, reading just because we had to. As time passed by I realized for myself that this was something much more than just words. I then started to make my studies more personal. I did so by always coming with a question in my mind and heart. Doing so gave purpose and meaning to my studies. Later I progressed to using other resources to further my studies rather than just the books themselves. Speeches from BYU, books by church leaders, and talks from General Conference have allowed me to have a better quality of personal studies. In the future, I hope to retain this habit by sharing what I have experienced with others. The effects this will have on my family and friends will be priceless. I hope that I can be a great example to all of them and that they will get out of it what I had and so much more.</p>
                        <p>As I have made an effort to be inclusive of diverse people in my social circles, I have observed that the relations of the cliques I take part in are held together by their members' sameness. This allowed me to see that unity allows groups of people to work well together and coexist in their own circles. Thinking of my personal relationships, I have seen unity as a great need, not in a way that is lacking but rather as something to continue improving upon. Being on a mission has allowed me to meet many people from different cultures and backgrounds. One of the ways I was able to build a relationship with these people was to look for and build on commonalities. By doing so, they opened up to me, thus allowing me to learn more about them and continue building our friendship. Using this same principle, I have applied it to my relationships in my family and community to build unity. With my family, every time I get the opportunity to talk with them I always make sure to not be self-centered. At times, it may be easy to talk about personal problems simply expecting the other party to listen, but I have come to know that when we are invested in others that we can also find solutions or the tools we need to solve our own challenges. By having this greater sense of unity, my relationship with them has become better than it was prior to my going on a mission. As a missionary, I have also had the opportunity to serve in multiple communities. Learning the culture of the places I served in and getting to know the people as individuals, allowed me to see connections between people that others wouldn't normally be able to see on the surface.  I was able to connect members with other members and non-members when they needed them thus building relationships that would otherwise be nonexistent. Unity is a necessity for any group of people to live in harmony and with happiness. I hope to continue to build upon this as I become part of the BYU community and help bring people together.
